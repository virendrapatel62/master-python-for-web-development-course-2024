You are tasked with creating a simple 
Python script that collects basic personal 
information from a user and stores it in 
a JSON file. The script should:

Prompt the user to enter their name.
Prompt the user to enter their age
(ensuring it is a valid integer).
Create a dictionary with the user's name and age.
Write this dictionary to a file named student_data.json 
in JSON format.
Handle potential errors gracefully, 
such as invalid input for age, and provide appropriate error messages.
